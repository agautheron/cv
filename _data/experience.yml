    Inside the modelisation and simulation team of Essilor, my internship goal was to implement a new eye-spectacles model with wavefront characterization inspired from an existing one in MATLAB.|
    In particular, I have adapted the Navarro eye-model to match with ametropic cases. I have also validate the wavefront computation with external tools like Zemax or infinitesimal computation of prescription.|
    At the end I just began to look at neural network to try to implement a brain identification of pictures.
